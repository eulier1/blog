# Dedicate to outcomes : 42hrs + 1890 USD, to setup a Shopifyâ€™s client app dev as a 5 years web developer with zero knowledge of Shopify.

Timeline explaining the process

### July 4, 2023
- Client contact me on Upwork after review my proposal as well as my social links ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eulier-gonzalez-69079096/), [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@eulier1), [Github](https://github.com/eulier1))
- With over **5 years** of experience as web developer, but **no prior experience** with **Shopify**, client is uneasy with that.
- To tackle that objection I propose to have a meeting next day to do even more fact findings

    Client show me the project and I propose an offer (knowing that offer is the king) :
    
     - Ask chatgpt to develop a roadmap to **learn** Shopify high levels concepts in **2** days with **NO CHARGES** (a way to add free value, following the principles from [Consulting: The Complete Freelancer's Guide](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-freelance-consulting/) of [Zero To Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/))

    Client agree

    After [recording the learning process](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_sapWkWdZHHTNSmusW1a0zRLiiQ6jGq1) on Youtube and post it on LinkedIn, the client show me in detail more about it's app and business logic, and we negotiate 10hrs package weekly to start with.


### July 10 - 14, 2023

- Contract re-negotiation to **15hrs** weelky
- **Conduct a research** about it's business, competitor analysis and up-to date data from news (Even thought client doesn't need it, but add value and perspective about what are we doing)
- Recording a much more [formal learning process of Shopify in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_sapWkWdZHEvxM2iVI9QqqTHcCCOMk9m)
- Learning about Shopify App & Theme Archictetures
- Following docs to create an example app of [Shopify App Development](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/build-app-example)


### July 17 - 25, 2023

- Keep recording [formal learning process of Shopify in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_sapWkWdZHEvxM2iVI9QqqTHcCCOMk9m)
- Learning about Shopify App & Theme Archictetures
- Following docs to create an example app of [Shopify App Development](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/build-app-example)
- Setup Client's Shopify Development (Locally and Admin Dashboard)


## Observations

1. Due the several Shopify moving parts such as :

    - Shopify Partners
    - Shopify Store Development
    - Shopify App Theme Development
    - App Setup (At Shopify Partners)
    - Client's lack of Docker-composer to run several services at once
    - Client's project recently migrate to Shopify CLI 3.x

    It took quite amount of time to my eyes.

## Recomendations

1. Define a docker-composer.yml to spin up services quickly
2. Define a more clear instructions to run Shopify App
3. Define instructions for install and run Shopify App Extentions

## Net Time Invested

49 hours.
