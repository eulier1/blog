# Roadmap generated by ChatGPT to fix a bug for a Shopify Client's App

With 5 years of experience but a neophyte with Shopify Platform, I ask ChatGPT to develop a **3 day** roadmap to fix a bug in the client's app.

### ChatGPT Prompt

```bash
Develop a roadmap of 3 days to fix a bug on a liquid file as an experience web developer with 5 years of experience but new to Shopify platform. Provide a schedule to dedicate time
```

### ChatGPT Output

Day 1: Understanding and Setup

    Morning:
        Set up the development environment: Install Shopify CLI and create a new development store.
        Familiarize with the Shopify file structure and understand the role of Liquid files in the platform.

    Afternoon:
        Study the bug report or issue description to understand the problem.
        Reproduce the bug on the development store to observe its behavior firsthand.
        Begin reviewing the relevant Liquid file to identify the potential causes.

Day 2: Bug Fixing and Testing

    Morning:
        Continue debugging the Liquid file to identify the root cause of the bug.
        Implement the necessary changes in the Liquid file to fix the bug.
        Test the fix on the development store to ensure the bug is resolved.

    Afternoon:
        Conduct thorough testing, including cross-browser and cross-device testing.
        Perform regression testing to ensure the fix hasn't caused any new issues.
        Document the bug fix and the steps taken for future reference.

Day 3: Deployment and Verification

    Morning:
        Prepare for deployment by backing up the current theme files.
        Merge the bug fix into the main theme or create a pull request (if using version control).

    Afternoon:
        Deploy the fixed Liquid file to the live store using Shopify CLI or admin interface.
        Monitor the live store for a period to verify that the bug is genuinely fixed and no new issues arise.
        Seek feedback from users or stakeholders to confirm their satisfaction with the fix.

Suggested Time Allocation:

    Day 1: Understanding and Setup (Approx. 6-8 hours)
    Day 2: Bug Fixing and Testing (Approx. 8-10 hours)
    Day 3: Deployment and Verification (Approx. 4-6 hours)


Ok, now let's do it.
