# Learn shopify in 2 days using chatgpt to prove my worth to a client on Upwork

After contact a client on Upwork that need someone with experience in Nuxt & Shopify.

However with over 5 years of experience as web developer and no prior experience with Shopify.
I ask the client to give me **2 days** to ask ChatGPT to develop a roadmap to **learn** the bigger picture of Shopify.

The prompt engineering process:

1. Define the idea
2. Write a prompt
3. Evaluate result
4. Refine Idea/Prompt, until you get your desired output.

It was following the [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering For Developer Personal Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYEFHq9v7jFfZCY0cIdhLhvaEdbXbDNLU0A1BGDRDgc/edit#), from [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) made by [DeepLearningAI Website](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
