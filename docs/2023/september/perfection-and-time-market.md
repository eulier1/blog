# Perfection vs Time Market.

## TL;DR 
- Build an audience or find an audience to help on their pain points
- Build and launch a product (software in this case) as fast as possible
- Get enough cashflow to later on face challenge such as scalability and maintainance

## Abstract

Since I'm helping a Client with their Shopify App for Merchants & Customers.

My client with over 7 years of experience with Shopify, teach me a valuable lesson about launch a product.

Because after 3 years in the market, he hires me not only to bugfix and implement features, but also to make it's SCALABLE and easy to MAINTAIN while providing value as fast as possible. Which are challenges that most software applications eventually will face.

The potential maintainance issue from it apps are :
- Server doesnâ€™t follow the MVC pattern or any scalable & easy to maintain pattern
- No SoC (Separation of Concern) between Controllers (Routes) and Data Layer (SQL Ops using Postgres)
- Seniors (not to mention Junior) developers will take quite amount of time to understand the Project's Architecture and ultimately bugfix, add features, manage migration and improve performance
