# Migrate from ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª to ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

After a large hiatus and a wild experience **migrating** from **Puerto Ordaz**, Venezuela, passing to **Pacaraima**, **Boa Vista**, **Manaus** in bus and from there taking a airplane to **Fortaleza**, **Sao Paulo** (Brasil) to finally reach to **Buenos Aires**. 

Took me 5 days doing such journey, and when i reach the landlord doesn't want to accept my Paypal transfer, cause she doesn't know how to extract it, but she previously accept $120 for not renting the place to someone else.

Nevertheless a cousin help me to stay in his home for a couple until i find a place. December 2019 will be a month that i would never forget, not only for the migration, cause also in 31th of that month i **start to working in a startup**. And my **first assigment?**, **migrate** a **VueCLI Project** to **Nuxt**. Which is something i'll explain how to do it in next entry.
