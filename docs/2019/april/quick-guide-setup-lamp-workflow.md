# Quick guide for Linux Apache Mysql PHP (LAMP) Workflow :computer: :zap:

Well actually i'm gonna use this article to set references (that eulier from the future could use ) for quickly set-up a LAMP Workflow.

So first

### [Install LAMP Stack From Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/como-instalar-en-ubuntu-18-04-la-pila-lamp-linux-apache-mysql-y-php-es)

and then if we're gonna labour on multiple php-based project

### [Multiple Custom PHP Applications is the way to go](https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/infrastructure/lamp/administration/create-custom-application-php/)

I made this entry to have a single source when setup a LAMP workflow easily.

Let the creation never stop. :vulcan_salute:
